### solarGL
This OpenGL app was constructed within openFrameworks. openFrameworks can be downloaded  at http://openframeworks.cc/ and this code can then be loaded as an app within the framework.

A run-through of the code with illustration of its various options can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/DtQHHQ0sR2E

You can see in the video that as you go through an Earth orbit that the North and South Poles will point closer or farther from the Sun. As the North Pole is pointing closer, the Northern hemisphere would be experiencing summmer, and the Southern hemisphere would have winter, and vice-versa.

You'll also notice that the same face of the Moon is always facing Earth. That's due to the fact that the Moon's orbital and rotational periods are the same. Thus, as the Moon orbits Earth, it rotates to compensate so as to always present the same face to the Earth. You'll also see that the entire moon is lit up at various points in its orbit. Thus, there is no "Sark Side of the Moon". Sorry, Pink Floyd.

There's also some Perlin noise on the Sun that kind of, sort of looks like convective motions on the solar surface. For the real thing, check out a proper video from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (disregard the music): https://youtu.be/4GScQwWtBk0
